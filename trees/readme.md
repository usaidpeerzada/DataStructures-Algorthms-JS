## Trees:

- A tree is a data structure where a node can have zero or more children. Each node contains a value, and similar to graphs each node can have a connection between other nodes called an edge. A tree is a type of graph but not all graphs are trees.
- The top-most node is called the root. The DOM, or document object model, is a tree data structure.
- A node without children is called a leaf node.
- The height of the tree is the distance between the farthest leaf node and the root node.

### Binary Tree:

- Binary trees are a special type of tree in which each node can only have a maximum of two children: a left child and a right child.

### Full Binary Trees:
- A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has exactly zero or two children (but never one).
### Complete Binary Trees:
- A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels except the last one are full with nodes.
### Perfect Binary Trees:
- A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels, including the last level, are full of nodes.

### Binary Search Trees:
- A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree where the values of every node to the left are less than its value and the values of every node to the right are greater than its value.
