## Graphs:

- A graph is a data structure composed of a collection of nodes and edges. Graphs are a non-linear data structure (as opposed to a linked list, stack, or queue). You may also hear nodes referred to as vertices.
- Graphs are used to solve many real-world problems and can be used to represent networks.
- Let’s say you’re a school bus driver, for example, and you want to illustrate the different ways you can complete your bus route each school morning to maximize efficiency, you can use a graph to map it out (this is a version of the Traveling Salesman problem, also known as an NP-Hard problem, and would take a lot of time to solve).

### There are two types of graphs:
* Directed graphs.
* Undirected graphs.

### Directed Graphs:
* A directed graph contains edges which function similarly to a one-way street; they have a direction. For example you might have a graph where people can have favorite foods but foods don’t have favorite people.

### Undirected Graphs:
* An undirected graph, in contrast, contains edges which flow bidirectionally, like a two- way street. For example you might have a graph of pets where people have pets and pets have owners. The relationship goes both ways.
